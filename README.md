# Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)
Practice from the book "Reliable Javascript", by Spencer and Richards, 2015.

This uses Jasmine v2 from CDN.
The book follows a TDD methodology.

### Note:
In the root directory you have the source code from the book.
Within the "practice" folder there is my own code with (usually highly detailed) comments.

### How to Run the Sample Code

The files come in trios tied together by a sequence number, nn, which is 01, 02, etc.

- Aop_nn.js is a subject under test.
- Aop_nn_tests.js contains the tests.
- index_nn.js is the HTML file that runs the tests with Jasmine.

The final version has no 'nn' suffix. Aop.js is tested by Aop_tests.js using index.html.

To run a trio, just open index_nn.html in your web browser.
